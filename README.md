# Jayant Chauhan

## 👋 About Me
I’m a Computer Science undergraduate (Class of 2028) at Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT), Delhi. I specialize in systems programming, open-source development, and building AI-driven applications. I enjoy working close to the metal with compiler internals just as much as I enjoy architecting scalable web platforms and intelligent video analysis pipelines. 

Whether I'm debugging AST handling in a compiler frontend, optimizing automated video editing workflows, or building out production-ready Next.js applications, I focus on writing clean, performant, and scalable code.
